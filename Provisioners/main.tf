# when provisioner will fail, whole resource will be marked as tainted (polish: ska≈ºony). And during nex terraform apply, this resource will be recreated.check "" 
# But there is also param: on_failure = continue / fail
# we can setup the behevior what to do, and if mark the resource as tainted after provisioner failure.
